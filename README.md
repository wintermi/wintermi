# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

## About

Welcome, I am Matthew Winter, a Principal Architect at Google Cloud.  Originally from the United Kingdom, before migrating to Melbourne, Australia which has now been my home for 15+ years.

I am a seasoned technical professional with 22+ years of data, analytics and cloud experience from various past and current roles including Engineering, Sales Engineering, Solution Architecture and Consultancy.  I am known for my passion and drive to succeed, along with an unending energy and work ethic.

In an attempt to push myself to share my experiences and learnings publicly, I have been creating these GitHub repositories.  Initially focused on the technology I am exploring both in my personal quests as well as working with customers to help deliver transformative and innovative solutions using Google Cloud.  I hope that you find them useful.
